# Git and GitHub Intro Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Let's apply what we've learned from class to share and update each other's code.  With a partner, you're going going to alternate between who 'drives' and who 'navigates' while following the requirements under "Exercise" below. The goal will be to create a project, have a partner fork, clone, and edit the project, submit the changes as a pull request, and then have the changes merged.

Be sure to look at the previous lesson for notes and helpful hints.

## Exercise

Partners will be referred to as partner1 and partner2.

### Part 1

**With partner1 driving:**

- create a repository in github
- clone the repository in your computer using `git clone`

- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice` inside

- within that folder create the following files `index.html`, `style.css`, and `scripts.js`
  - 'cd git-and-github-practice'
- copy and paste the code from the [starter-code](starter-code) from the `index.html` and `style.css` into your own
- add `// JavaScript to be added` to your `scripts.js` file and link it in your HTML File
- commit your changes, and push to GitHub


**With partner2 driving, from their computer:**

- get your partners link to the GitHub repository and fork and clone it
- open the project and edit the `scripts.js` file adding some funny message
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner1

**With partner1 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface


### Part 2

**With partner2 driving**:
- create a repository in github
- clone the repository in your computer using `git clone`

- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice` inside
-  within that folder create the following files `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`
-  copy and paste the code from the merged pull request files (of your partners `git-and-github-practice` project) from each of the appropriate files to your own
- commit your changes, and push to GitHub
> Note: Partner2 should now have the solution from Part 1 locally

**With partner1 driving:**

- get your partner's link to the new GitHub repository - fork and clone it
- open the project and make sure to thank your partner editing the `script.js` file
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner2


**With partner2 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface

**Bonus**:

- use the [syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) documentation to update partner2's local version of `git-and-github-practice` without copying and pasting any code
- push the updated local copy to GitHub


#### Starter code

We've given you the HTML/CSS needed to get going in the [starter-code](starter-code).

#### Deliverable

You should have two separate GitHub repositories that have merged pull requests.

## How to Submit

This lab will be checked in class
